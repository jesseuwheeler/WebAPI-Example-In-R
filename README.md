# WebAPI-Example-In-R
This repository contains several examples on how to access data through web-baased APIs and the R programming language. The files used in this repository will be used in a USU Data Science Club meeting on Jan 15, 2020. 

## Instructions

In order to run the code in this repository, you will need to make a free account at the following websites: 
* [openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api)
* [ipstack.com/](https://ipstack.com/)
* [www.quandl.com/](https://www.quandl.com/)

If you plan on attending the meeting I would recommend that you sign up for an account at at least one of these websites. None of these websites will send you spam mail or anything and it only takes a second to sign up.

Once you have signed up for an account, you will recieve a unique API key that will allow you to get data from these websites. In each of the R-Scripts in this repository there are instructions on how to save these codes in order for the R scripts to run without any modificaiton. 

Once you have done that, download or clone this repository. To clone the repository, navigate to the desired location and use: 
`git clone https://github.com/jesseuwheeler/WebAPI-Example-In-R.git`.
